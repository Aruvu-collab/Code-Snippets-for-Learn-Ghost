## Discovery of Courses (Discovery)

**Are there any interesting courses that I can take?**

Our learning modules are co-designed to offer multiple entry points with flexible structure so you can find your own learning rhythm and choose modules that resonate with your ineterst & practice. We offer various types of modules ranging from short, concentrated bursts of activity to longer, more immersive experiences. These include Primers, Travelling Studio, Make-a-thons, Workshops, and Electives focusing on different concentrations such as Reimagining Technology, Sensitive Ecologies, Community Wellbeing, Syncretic Cultures & Practices and Wellbeing of Craft Practices.

**How is this different from a regular academic course?**

Unlike traditional academic courses, our modules emphasise place-based learning, situated knowledge, and co-learning through lived experiences. We engage with local communities, practitioners, and materials, creating a learning environment that's deeply rooted in context and practice, enabling learning retention for the learners to continue to connect praxis with theory as they shape their careers.

**Are there any prerequisites for joining the modules?**

Rather than focusing on prerequisites, we value what each learner brings to the learning experience. Different modules are designed to accommodate diverse backgrounds and skill sets. Some benefit from specific knowledge or experience, while others welcome complete beginners. Each course description includes a section titled "We are looking for..." that outlines the qualities, perspectives and experiences that would enrich the collective learning environment.

## Choosing the Course (Scoping)

**How much time commitment is required for each module?**

Time commitment varies by module type. The specific NLH (Notional Learning Hours) is listed in each course description. Notional Learning Hours represent the total time a learner is expected to spend on a module, including contact hours, independent study, field work, collaborative making, assignments, and other course related works. Understanding NLH helps diverse learners with different circumstances—such as part-time students, working professionals, or those with caregiving responsibilities etc—plan their schedules accordingly and make informed decisions about which modules best align with their availability and learning capacity.

**How much money would I need to spend?**

The course fee per learner differs according to the total NLH (Notional Learning Hours) for each course. Each course has its own cost structure depending on its characteristics. Here are the costs covered and/or not-covered in the course fees:

- **Primers**: Local commute and material costs are included in the fees. Travel, food, and accommodation costs are not covered.
- **Travelling Studios**: Costs for accommodation (shared rooms), local commute, travel, food, and materials are all covered in the overall module cost.
- **Electives**: Cover accommodation, travel, food, and local travel costs (if happening outside Bangalore like in Bidar/Kundapura).
- **Practicums**: Travel cost to reach the location is borne by the learner, while accommodation, local travel, and food are covered in the course cost.
- **Core Pathways**: Travel, accommodation, local commute, and food costs are covered, but material costs must be borne by the learner.
- **Workshops**: Only material costs are included. Learners must travel to the workshops on their own. As well as cover the expenses of local commute, Food and Accommodation.
- **Make-A-thons**: Material costs are covered, with minimal other operational costs as these typically happen in one location.

**How much further in time can I plan it out?**

Our courses are organised in trimesters, with offerings planned through 2025-2026. You can review upcoming modules in our course catalogue to plan ahead for future trimesters. We understand that learners need time to prepare their application package, schedule interviews, and join their selected cohort. Our application cycle is announced periodically with the following typical timeline for each stage of application:

- Prepare application package and submit - 2 to 4 weeks
- Scheduling interview - Advanced notice of one week
- Acceptance of offer and joining the cohort - 1 to 3 weeks

This timeline allows you to properly plan your application process and make necessary arrangements to join your chosen course.

**Can I seek financial assistance?**

As a self-funded institute, we are currently unable to offer financial assistance to learners. However, we are committed to making our institute accessible to a diverse range of learners in the future. With this goal in mind, we are actively seeking funds to provide financial support beginning next year. We plan to implement a tiered financial support system for learners accepted to our courses from September 2026 onwards.

## Orientation (Onboarding)

**What do I need to plan for again?**

 Details are provided in each course description, we recommend you to read them in course pages. Additionally, each course will have a comprehensive handbook that will help guide learners through the course structure, requirements, and expectations. This handbook will be shared after the cohort is formed for each course, giving you all the information you need to prepare effectively. For most courses, you'll need to prepare by installing necessary software and familiarising yourself with platforms such as Notion, Discord, Zotero, and Nextcloud. Some courses may require specific materials like sketchbooks, journals, art supplies, or recording equipment etc

**What other learning pathways exist?**

Our learning pathways are structured around five concentrations: Community Wellbeing, Sensitive Ecologies, Reimagining Technology, Syncretic Cultures & Practices and Wellbeing of Craft Art & Practices. Within each concentration, you can choose different module types (Primers, Workshops, Make-a-thons, Electives, Travelling Studios) based on your interests and availability. You can read more about these pathways in our Curriculum page.

**Do I need to prepare to read or consume some pre-requisities?**

Absolutely! We encourage you to explore the orientation materials provided before your course begins. You'll discover engaging introductory readings, inspiring sample works, and thought-provoking reflection prompts that will set the stage for your learning experience and help you connect with the course's context from day one.
